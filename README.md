**atom_open_in_terminal**

This pacakge is designed to work with the atom.io editor which is running under the *[linux mate](http://mate-desktop.org/)* desktop environment.

With "open_in_terminal", a user can open a terminal window, at the location passed to it from atom, from the tree-view & the editor.

To install package from command line:

    apm install open_in_terminal

Thanks to lmatt-bit's open_in_terminal, for your work on open_in_cmd. Your work inspired me to modify your work to create my first atom package "open_in_terminal" package.

**Short Term Development Goals**
I am interested in finding a way to get the atom editor plugin to grab a list of installed linux terminal emulators (ie - xterm, mate-terminal, gnome-terminal, etc) and presenting them as options in the preferences screen for the user to select as there terminal emulator of choice. I am also interested in finding a way to grab the terminal application that has been set in the preferred applications settings window.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or pull requestes.
