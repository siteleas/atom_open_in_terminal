# atom_open_in_terminal
This pacakge is designed to work with the atom.io editor which is running under the [b]linux mate[b] desktop environment.

With "open_in_terminal", a user can open a terminal window, at the location passed to it from atom, from the tree-view & the editor.

To install package from command line:

apm install open_in_terminal

Thanks to lmatt-bit's open_in_terminal, for your work on open_in_cmd. Your work inspired me to modify your work to create my first atom package "open_in_terminal" package.
